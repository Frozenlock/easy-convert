* Usage
  Call the =easy-convert-interactive= command to convert units from
  the minibuffer.

  For example:
  : Old value and unit (type C-z for unit list) : 100oz
 
  : to unit (type C-z for unit list) : g

  : 100oz converted to g = 2834.9523125 g

  Because this program is built on top of calc-units, it understands
  he usual prefixes, such as k (kilo), m (milli), y (yocto)...

  : Old value and unit (type C-z for unit list) : kg
 
  : to unit (type C-z for unit list) : g

  : kg converted to g = 1000 g

* Installation
  
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "<easy-convert-installation-path>")
  
  : (require 'easy-convert)

  Optionally, you can bind it to a key sequence:

  : (global-set-key (kbd "C-c u") (quote easy-convert-interactive))
